1. Fix Client and Employee classes: implement getSurname method.  
Client should have prefix before value as "Mr./Mrs. "

2. Implement proper toString methods for Client and Employee classes to be more like Person implementation with additional fields.  
Hint: name, surname and phone are private for child classes, use proper getters.

3. Implement proper equals and hashCode methods for Client and Employee classes.

4. Implement ClientTest tests for rules of [hashCode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode--)

5. Implement EmployeeTest tests for rules of [equals](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object-)
